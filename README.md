## DATA GENERATOR FOR (JSON, Ruby on Rails migrations, SQL queries and EXCEL tables)

### What is this tool for?
This is a random data generator for developers or anyone that needs random mock data for migrating to a database or for any other use. This generator has several options to be chosen from such as `name, email, password, random dates, e.t.c`. Users are allowed to preview the random data before exporting to any format of their choice such as `JSON, RUBY, SQL and EXCEL (more formats will be added in the future)`.

### Why was this project created?
This project was created due to the little to no generator out there on the web that can be used to generate random ready to migrate data for Ruby on Rails(RoR) devs out there.

### Features

- Ruby on Rails migration file generation
- Export as excel
- Export as SQL
